fonttable

Print font tables from a LaTeX document.

/macros/latex/contrib/fonttable
	
This is a package version of nfssfont.tex (part of the LaTeX distribution); it enables you to print a table of the characters of a font and/or some text (for demonstration or testing purposes), from within a document. (Packages such as testfont and nfssfont.tex provide these facilities, but they run as interactive programs: the user is expected to type details of what is needed.)

Note that the package mftinc also has a \fonttable function; the documentation explains how avoid a clash with that package.
