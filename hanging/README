    The hanging package facilitates the typesetting of hanging paragraphs.
It also enables typesetting with hanging punctuation; I don't necessarily
recommend this.

Changes in version 1.2
- Option for less aggressive hanging punctuation

Changes in version 1.1
- Should now work with the ltugboat class
- Takes options to exclude punctuations characters from being hung
