________________________________
The BEZ123 and MULTIPLY packages

    LaTeX can be used for drawing quadratic Bezier curves. The bez123 
package provides additional facilities for drawing linear, cubic, and
rational quadratic Bezier curves. The multiply package provides a
command for multiplication of a length without numerical overflow.

README (this file)
bez123.dtx
bez123.ins
bez123.pdf
  and the derived files:
bez123.sty
multiply.sty

----------------------------------------------------------------- 

    To install the package:
- run: latex bez123.ins (which will generate bez123.sty and multiply.sty)
- Move bez123.sty and multiply.sty to a location where LaTeX will find them
  (typically in a local texmf tree at tex/latex/bez123) and refresh the
  file database. See the FAQ on CTAN at help/uk-tex-faq or
  https://texfaq.org/ for more information on this.
    To process the manual:
- run: latex bez123.dtx (Note that bez123.dtx requires bez123.sty.
                         Several Package Warning messages will occur, but
                         these can be ignored.)
- run: makeindex -s gind.ist bez123
- run: latex bez123.dtx
- Print bez123.dvi for a hardcopy of the package manual
